                My name is Brian. I was born and raised in San Francisco. 
                I am a bartender at the moment, but I hope to pick up a developer role in the near future.

                I am taking this class to learn the best way to make web apps and for some accountability. 
                I have been learning on my own, but it has been tough for me to keep a consistent study 
                schedule. I hope this class provides me with the structure and motivation I believe I need.
