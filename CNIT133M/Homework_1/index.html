                My name is Brian. It's short for Briandrious Reynaldous the Great. 
                I was born on the USS Straw Hat where I raised by a league of extraordinary individuals.
                My mother was a reindeer who lived on a cold island off the shores of Aifergot. She ate a Human-Human fruit and turned human.
